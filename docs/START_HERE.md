## 🎓 The Strategy Behind the Schedule

**Why Evening Focus?**
- 55% of trips occur 6 PM - 11 PM
- Evening orders typically pay 30-50% more
- Dinner delivery demand is consistent and predictable

**Why Weekends are Priority?**
- Saturday & Sunday = 2x the trip volume of Monday-Wednesday
- Friday kicks off weekend demand spike
- Thursday builds momentum into the weekend

**Why These Specific Zones?**
- Your data shows TX 75206, 75204, 75219 are proven high-volume areas
- Clustering in one zone saves time vs. jumping around city
- Efficiency = more trips/hour = higher earnings

**Why Split Shifts?**
- Lunch (11 AM - 2 PM) = supplementary income with lower competition
- Evening (6-11 PM) = your primary earning window
- Split lets you rest between peaks, staying fresh for rush hours

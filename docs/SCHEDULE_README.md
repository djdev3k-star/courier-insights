## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Earnings 25%+ Below Target?
1. Check your acceptance rate (need >95%)
2. Verify you're in top 3 zones during peak hours
3. Review if you're working full scheduled hours
4. Check if cancellation rate is high (kills algorithm)
5. Add 1-2 hour flex shifts on Wed/Sun to compensate

### Can't Hit Evening Targets?
1. Verify you're actually online 6-11 PM (platform time zone issue?)
2. Check if zone has sudden demand shift (use secondary zones)
3. Ensure your app is updated (bugs can affect order delivery)
4. Check acceptance rate - platforms throttle low-acceptance drivers

### Too Exhausted?
1. Drop Sunday shift (only $75, frees 2 hours)
2. Reduce Wednesday to 1-hour lunch only
3. Use more selective order acceptance (reject long distances)
4. Extend breaks between peak windows
5. Work only 4 high-earning days instead of 5-6

### Making Too Much (Time to Celebrate)?
1. Reduce lowest-performing shifts (usually Wednesday)
2. Work half-shifts instead of full shifts
3. Take a day off mid-week
4. Maintain quality over quantity (stay efficient, not exhausted)

## 🔍 Algorithm Tips from Your Data

The courier platforms favor drivers who:

1. **Maintain consistency** - Work same hours = better order routing
2. **High acceptance rate** - >95% = priority access to surge orders
3. **Low cancellation** - <5% = algorithm confidence
4. **Stay engaged** - Online during peak hours = better assignments
5. **Complete fast** - Quick delivery = more orders queued for you

**This schedule MAXIMIZES all of these.**

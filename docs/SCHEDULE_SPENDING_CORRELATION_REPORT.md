| Highest Spending Day | Sunday ($830.67) | Also your busiest restaurant day (87 pickups) |
| Highest Work Day | Sunday (223 total trips) | Busiest = most hungry = most temptation |

| **Potential Monthly Savings** | **$40-100/month** | By eliminating restaurant dining during deliveries |

### 🚨 KEY FINDING
**Sunday and Saturday are your vulnerability days.** You do 34.6-39% of your restaurant pickups on these days AND spend the most money ($830.67 on Sunday, $710.96 on Saturday). The correlation is clear: **proximity to restaurants while waiting between deliveries = increased personal spending.**

- **Friday:** 53 restaurant trips, $585.09 spending = $11.04/trip ✓ Controlled

## 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **SUNDAY/SATURDAY MEAL PREP** (HIGHEST IMPACT)
These are your busiest restaurant days. Pack 2-3 meals:
- **Savings:** $15-20/day × 8 days (Sat+Sun per month) = **$120-160/month saved**
- **Why it works:** Eliminates the decision when hungry; you already have food

### 2. **RAISING CANES ELIMINATION** (QUICK WIN)
You visit Raising Canes frequently. If you eliminated these $30 orders:
- **Current:** $813.86 per 5 months = **$162/month**
- **Savings:** If you pack meals instead = **$150/month saved**

### 3. **LATE NIGHT STRATEGY** (TIME-BASED)
Most restaurant pickups happen 10 PM - 1 AM. Set a rule:
- Eat a substantial meal at 9 PM before your shift
- Bring snacks (granola bar, nuts, protein bar) for 2-3 AM if needed
- **Savings:** $3-5/night × 20 nights = **$60-100/month saved**

### 4. **DOLLAR TREE AUDIT** ($297.93/month)
What are you buying? If it's snacks/beverages:
- Stock up at Costco instead = **50% savings**
- Pack reusable water bottle
- **Potential savings:** $150/month

### 5. **TRACK SPENDING CORRELATION**
Monitor your spending the next 2 weeks:
- Note which restaurant pickups lead to personal spending
- Identify your trigger merchants
- **Goal:** Reduce post-pickup spending by 50%

**72.2% of your uncategorized spending ($2,876.24) occurs at locations where you also pick up food deliveries.**

### Most Problematic Pickup-Location Spending:

| Merchant | Your Spending | Pickup Trips | Temptation Factor |
|----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| McDonald's (various) | $265+ | 1,006+ | 🔴 EXTREME |
| Walmart/Tom Thumb | $71+ | 900+ | 🔴 EXTREME |
| Jack in the Box | $10+ | 974+ | 🔴 EXTREME |
| Schlotzskys | $5.41 | 933+ | 🔴 EXTREME |
| QT (QuikTrip) | $64+ | 933+ | 🔴 EXTREME |
| Dollar Tree | $431 | 57+ | 🟠 HIGH |

| Raising Canes | $814 | 106+ | 🟠 HIGH |
| Sonic Drive In | $4+ | 946+ | 🔴 EXTREME |

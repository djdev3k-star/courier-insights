## Decision Tree for Each Shift

```
START SHIFT
    ↓
Is it 6 PM - 11 PM? 
    ├─ YES → Go to PRIMARY ZONE (75206, 75204, 75219)
    │        Stay active all shift
    │        Target: 12-15 trips per shift
    │        ✓ You'll hit your targets
    │
    └─ NO → Is it Lunch (11 AM - 2 PM)?
            ├─ YES → Go to PRIMARY ZONE
            │        Target: 5-7 trips per 2h
            │        ✓ Good supplementary earnings
            │
            └─ NO → Are you scheduled?
                    ├─ YES → Go to PRIMARY ZONE if possible
                    │        Otherwise go HOME
                    │
                    └─ NO → Go HOME & rest
                            You'll need energy for next peak hour shift
```

## Monthly Earnings Breakdown

**To reach $3,050/month you need:**

- **8 days × $200** = $1,600 (Thu, Fri, Sat + 1 Tuesday or Tuesday variant)
- **4 days × $100** = $400 (Wed + 3 others)
- **14 days × $75** = $1,050 (Mon, Sun + fill days)

**You already have 4 guaranteed $200 days:**
- Thursday evening
- Friday evening
- Saturday all-day
- Tuesday all-day

**Just 4 more $200-days needed = ACHIEVABLE**

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ Work 9 AM - 5 PM (low trip volume, waste of effort)
❌ Accept every trip (pick quality over quantity)
❌ Go past 11 PM regularly (diminishing returns after midnight)
❌ Leave your primary zones (75206, 75204, 75219) without reason
❌ Cancel trips regularly (hurts platform algorithm)
❌ Work inconsistent hours (platforms reward consistency)

---

## What TO Do

✓ Work the exact hours on the schedule
✓ Stay in primary zones 60% of time
✓ Reject trips >12 miles (2x average)
✓ Keep acceptance rate >95%
✓ Keep cancellation rate <5%
✓ Track $/mile and $/hour weekly
✓ Review yesterday's best hours before logging in
✓ Take 30-min breaks between rush windows
✓ Maintain vehicle (prevents downtime)

---

## Efficiency Targets

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| $/mile | $0.30+ | Track it |
| $/hour | $40+ | Track it |
| Trips/hour | 2-2.5 | Track it |
| Acceptance Rate | >95% | Track it |
| Cancellation Rate | <5% | Track it |

**Action: Update these weekly. If you're below target, adjust your zone.**

## First 4 Weeks Roadmap

### Week 1: Establish
- [ ] Block calendar with exact schedule
- [ ] Set phone alarms 30 min before each shift
- [ ] Map out primary 3 zones on GPS
- [ ] Test Tuesday split-shift

### Week 2: Measure  
- [ ] Track actual earnings vs. $150/$200/$100 targets
- [ ] Note which hours you got 0 offers (adjust next week)
- [ ] Calculate your $/mile and $/hour
- [ ] Write down what worked well

### Week 3: Optimize
- [ ] If primary zones underperforming, test secondary zones
- [ ] If you're below $40/hour in peak times, adjust zone
- [ ] Double-check your top 3 zones match historical data
- [ ] Prepare any adjustments for Week 4

### Week 4: Execute
- [ ] Implement any optimizations learned
- [ ] Calculate total month earnings
- [ ] Compare to $3,050 target
- [ ] Plan Month 2 strategy

---

## Emergency Adjustments

**If earnings are 25%+ below target:**
1. Add 1-2 hour shifts on Wed or Sun (buffer capacity)
2. Extend one evening shift to 11:30 PM or midnight
3. Increase zone coverage to include secondary zones
4. Check if acceptance rate dropped (this kills order assignments)

**If you're hitting targets but exhausted:**
1. Drop Sunday shift (costs only $75)
2. Shorten one Wednesday shift by 30 minutes
3. Use more selective order acceptance (quality > quantity)
4. Work fewer high-earning days, more conservatively

## Monthly Earnings Snapshot

| Month | Target | Stretch Goal | Cushion |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Full Month (26 work days) | $3,050 | $4,050 | $1,000 |
| Weekly Average | $1,125 | $1,500 | $230 |
| Daily Average (worked) | $117 | $156 | $38 |

**You have a 33% safety cushion. You don't need to hit every single target.**

---

## Platform Algorithm Tips

The courier platforms (Uber, DoorDash, etc.) use algorithms that favor:

1. **Consistency** - Same work hours every week = better order assignments
2. **Reliability** - Acceptance rate >95% = priority orders
3. **Responsiveness** - Low cancellation rate = more order offers
4. **Rating** - Stay above 4.9 stars = surge orders
5. **Velocity** - Faster completion = more orders queued

**This schedule is DESIGNED to maximize all of these.**

---

## Signs You Should Quit a Shift Early

- You've completed your daily target in 2 hours and it's low-demand time
- You haven't received an order in 15 minutes AND it's not a peak hour
- You're exhausted and making mistakes (risks cancellations)
- Your phone shows 0 active orders AND there's no incoming

**Don't just sit idle.** Go home, charge, prep for next shift.

## Tracking Spreadsheet (Keep Simple)

```
Date | Day | Shift Times | Trips | Distance | Earnings | $/mile | $/hr | Notes
-----|-----|-------------|-------|----------|----------|--------|------|-------
1/28 | Tue | 12p-2p,6p-10p | 12 | 72 | $210 | $2.92 | $42.00 | Great - stayed in zone
1/29 | Wed | 11a-1p,5p-7p  | 7   | 41 | $102 | $2.49 | $34.00 | Lower day - expected
```

**Monthly Summary:**
- Total Trips: ___
- Total Distance: ___
- Total Earnings: ___
- Average $/mile: ___
- Average $/hour: ___
- Hit Target?: YES / NO

## Remember

**This isn't random.** Your historical data shows clear patterns:
- Evenings beat mornings
- Weekends beat weekdays
- Three zones account for 23% of all trips
- 6 PM - 11 PM is where 55% of orders come from

**This schedule follows those patterns.**

Stick to it for 4 weeks. Track your actual earnings. Then you'll have real data to optimize even further.

**You've got this.** 💪
